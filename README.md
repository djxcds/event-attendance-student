# CyberAttendance Desktop Application
CyberAttendance for student

CyberAttendance is a desktop application for recording and monitoring students' attendance 
in an event as well as managing students, events, lists, event attendance and community
labor summary. This app may have the features to record attendance, it is still lacking 
features that may improve the monitoring of attendance such as printing the Community Labor 
Summary to a document file. You may modify project files to fit your likings. 

CyberAttendance for Admin is for users who will manage the attendance while CyberAttendance for 
Students is for users who will sign in or sign out from an event.

<b>Usage</b>
1. If you use the CyberAttendance Apps on one PC only, no need to change its connection string. 
Just install and run the latest stable version of WAMP or XAMPP to run smooth and error-free, and
import the zipped database file found in the database folder. In other hand, if you use the app on
2 or more PCs then the connection string must be changed to integrate it with the other PCs. 
2. In adding students into a list, the list you created only serves as template to add students to 
the attendance list. Making further changes to the list you created will not update the previous 
attendees list. I suggest that you must have a master list of students enrolled and then add
it to the list.
